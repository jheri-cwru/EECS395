1. Set up a postgres database according to what we discussed i.e the following tables:
	account_info(email, uuid, hash, pub_key)
	lists(email, uuid, analyzed_key, confidence_level)

2. Name the databae whatever you want obviously. keep in mind that postgres usually runs on port 5432 but I have the server 
connected over 5433 as I have two postgres services running. You can change the server configuration however you want by
changing stuff in the main.go file. All of that is documented in that file. Let me know if you have any problems.

3. Each HTTP method and how to format the requests is documented in the handlers.go files.

4. I hope you're running this on linux. If not, use the Ubuntu subsystem on windows to run it so that we don't run into any problems.
